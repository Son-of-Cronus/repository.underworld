## Introduction
The Underworld Repository is a Kodi add-on repository which allows you to install addons from the Underworld Repository.
## Installing the Underworld Repository
Starting from Kodi Leia (v18), you can easily install the Underworld Repository from the official <a href="https://github.com/Son-of-Cronus/underworld/tree/master/repository.underworld/" rel="nofollow">Underworld</a> add-on repository. Simply download the latest release and install it. You may need to enable unknown sources in your Kodi settings.
### Adding the Underworld Repository to your sources
There are two ways to add the Underworld Repository to your sources:
- In your main menu go and select “Addons” and select “Install from ZIP file”.
- Browse to the “repository.underworld-x.x.zip” you just downloaded, and select the zip file for installation.
- Wait until the notification appears that the repository was installed successfully.

Or:

- In your main menu go and select "system" and select "file manager".
- Select “Add source” and click on “None”.
- Type in the path “https://underworld.github.io/repo” and select “Done”.
- Highlight the name box underneath and type in the name "Underworld Repository” and click “OK”.
- Go back to your main menu and select “Addons” and select “Install from ZIP file”.
- Open the source “Underworld Repository” and select the file “repository.underworld-x.x.zip”
- Wait until the notification appears that the repository was installed successfully

<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure the Auto-Update option for addons from this repository is enabled to automagically receive new updates.

### Kodi Leia and Matrix
We support the previous and the current release of Kodi. So with the release of Kodi Matrix (v19), the support for Kodi Leia (v18) is continued and Krypton(v17) has been removed.
