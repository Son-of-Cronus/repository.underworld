## Introduction
The Underworld Repository is a Kodi add-on repository which allows you to install addons from the Underworld Repository.
## Installing the Underworld Repository
Starting from Kodi Leia (v18), you can easily install the Underworld Repository from the official <a href="https://github.com/Son-of-Cronus/underworld/tree/master/repository.underworld/" rel="nofollow">Underworld</a> add-on repository. Simply use the search function in the add-ons section to find RadioNL and install it.

<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure the Auto-Update option for addons from this repository is enabled to automagically receive new updates.

### Kodi Leia and Matrix
We support the previous and the current release of Kodi. So with the release of Kodi Matrix (v19), the support for Kodi Leia (v18) is continued and Krypton(v17) has been removed.
